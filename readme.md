_World Message allows users from around the world to start a quick and easy chat. Users are located using html5 geolocation, their positions are plotted on a google map._

## Contact Details

_please contact me at bdspen@gmail.com if you would like to contribute to the project, or have any other feedback. It is greatly appreciated._

## Known Bugs
* When a user(1) is in a chat and user(2) leaves the chat, there is no indication of that action. Chat flow needs to be worked out to be much more user friendly.
* chat requests will persist on screen when both users have exited chat.
* When a new user joins the application, their list item will appear even though thier map information has not been refreshed. I will need to create an auto update when a new user joins to smooth out the UX.
* When a user leaves the chat, the messages of the user who left will be deleted, they should persist.

## Technologies Used
