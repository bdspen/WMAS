#### By _**Benjamin Spenard**_

## Description

_World Message allows users from around the world to start a quick and easy chat. Users are located using html5 geolocation, their positions are plotted on a google map._

## Support and contact details

_please contact me if you would like to contribute to the project, or have any other feedback. It is greatly appreciated._

## Known Bugs
* When a user(1) is in a chat and user(2) leaves the chat, there is no indication of that action. Chat flow needs to be worked out to be much more user friendly.
* chat requests will persist on screen when both users have exited chat.
* When a new user joins the application, their list item will appear even though thier map information has not been refreshed. I will need to create an auto update when a new user joins to smooth out the UX.

## Technologies Used

Built with:
* AngularJS
* Firebase
* Google maps API
